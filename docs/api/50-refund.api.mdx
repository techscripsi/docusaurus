Use this method to refund a previously created and authorized cart or specific items in that cart. You can cancel the whole cart or specify items to cancel using `tags`, `itemIds`, or `timerEnabled` settings.

Overlaps are ignored, meaning that if you, for example, specify a `tag` and an `itemId` in the same request and the latter `itemId` is marked with the specified `tag`, the request will refund all specified items and will not return an error.

If a cart is refunded partially, the remaining items in that cart can be refunded later.
