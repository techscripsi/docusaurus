# Carts, Tags, and Items

OmniCart is designed to accept multiple items in a payment request by default so you can think of each payment request as a shopping cart, even if it contains a single item. Items in a cart can be marked with tags.

## Items in Carts

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      The code to the right is an example of a simple request with only the mandatory properties for the [initiate cart](/docs/api/init) request.
      
      Each cart must have a unique `cartId` that is generated on your side. The `currency` property is mandatory and applied to the entire cart. 
      
      The `pegasus` object here is an item identifier that contains the mandatory `amount` property (see [Amounts](/docs/concepts/amounts) section for more information on handling amounts).
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
      ```js
      {
        "cartId": "6f891edb-1e1f-48bb-b042-2cb790a0f402",
        "currency": "XAU",
        "items": [
          {
            "pegasus": {
              "amount": 250
            }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

:::info Please, note
All item identifiers have to be uploaded to OmniCart in the Merchant Panel <!-- ADDLINK --> to be available for purchase as each cart initiation request must contain at least one existing item identifier.
:::

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      An item is not necessarily an actual consumable product. It can be, for example, a donation, a one time purchase (such as a premium tier), or a temporary access to your resource (e.g., a year subscription).

      A cart may contain items of any type.

      In the example to the right the `items` array contains several item identifiers: `donation`, `milk`, and `premiumAccess`. This code implies these item identifiers were previously registered in the Merchant Panel <!-- ADDLINK -->.
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
      ```js
        "items": [
          {
            "lich": {
              "amount": 600
              },
            "wight": {
              "amount": 230
              },
            "vampire": {
              "amount": 500
              }
            }
        ]
      ```
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


## Tags

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      You can mark cart items with tags to group these items, batch apply payment or timer settings (batch settings are explained in the [section below](#overrides)), or for any other reason you may have. 

      An item can be assigned only one tag.

      OmniCart accepts all tags provided they have a valid format. If you really want it, you can use a different tag or set of tags for each [initiate cart](/docs/api/init) request. Since tags are generated on your side, you are in charge of their consistency.

      In the request snippet to the right, the `mage` and `naga` items are assigned the `tower` tag. The `beholder` item is marked with the `dungeon` tag and the `nomad` item doesn't have a tag at all.
      
      After a cart is initiated, you can utilize tags to [retrieve cart item statuses](/docs/api/status), <CancelLink />, [capture](/docs/api/capture), or <RefundLink /> items by calling the corresponding API methods (see also [Payment Lifecycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle) for more information on item statuses).
      
      Tags can also be redefined or reassigned by calling the <ModifyLink /> method â€” this option is described in detail in the [Modify](/docs/concepts/modify) section of this documentation.
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
      ```js
          "items": [
            {
              "mage": {
      //added
                "tag": "tower",
                "amount": 450
              }
            },
            {
              "naga": {
      //added
                "tag": "tower",
                "amount": 1600
              }
            },
            {
              "nomad": {
                "amount": 200
              }
            },
            {
              "beholder": {
      //added
                "tag": "dungeon",
                "amount": 280
              }
            },
          ]
      ```
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


## Batch Settings and Overrides {#overrides}

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      OmniCart allows you to batch apply certain payment settings and timer settings to items in a cart. These settings can be applied to the entire cart or by tag. The tag settings override the cart settings. The settings of a specific item, in turn, override all parent settings, even if this item is marked with a defined tag. Think of it as of nested structure or hierarchical inheritance, cart being the top level.
      
      :::note
      An item may or may not be assigned a tag. If an item is not assigned a tag, its settings still override the cart settings.
      :::
      
      Take a look at the code examples to the right. Cart level settings define only the `amountMode` and `capture` properties.
      
      Tag settings inherit `amountMode`, override the `capture` property, and define additional capture settings.
      
      Item settings override the parent `amountMode` and `autoAction` properties and add the `amountModifier` property for that specific item. Other settings are inherited.

:::info Please, note
In an actual request you can define as many tags as you want or assign them to items without defining.
* If you define a tag and do not assign it to any item, the [initiate cart](/docs/api/init) request will be accepted by OmniCart despite the fact that the defined tag has no practical effect on the request result.
* Similarly, if you assign an item with a tag that is not defined, it is not considered an error.
