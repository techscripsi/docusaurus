# Item Timers {#item-timers}

Timers are an additional way to manage the [payment life cycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle). They can be useful when providing temporary access to your products and services like subscriptions or premium app features. Timers require the `customerId` property to be passed with the request. `customerId` values are generated on your side.

OmniCart remembers the relation between the `customerId` value and the item identifier and prevents buying an item with an active timer for the specified customer. A timer is considered active in the `pending`, `started`, and `paused` statuses (see [Timer Life Cycle](#timer-life-cycle) section below).

## Timer Life Cycle {#timer-life-cycle}

Timer statuses can be retrieved using the [status](/docs/api/15-status) request. These statuses are returned per item.

    ### `pending`
    
    The `pending` status means that the current item has not entered a set timer trigger event. It is an active state, meaning that you cannot initiate another cart containing this item with the same `customerId` value.
    
    From the `pending` state a timer can be started by a trigger event or manually (see the [Starting a timer](#timer-start) section above).

    ### `started`

    The `started` status that the countdown is on. The remaining time (in seconds) is the value of the `remainingSecs` property of the `timerSnapshot` object in the [status](/docs/api/15-status) response.

    ### `paused`

    The `paused` status means that a timer has been manually stopped with the <ModifyLink /> request. It is an active state, meaning that you cannot initiate another cart containing this item with the same `customerId` value. From this state a timer can be manually unpaused or stopped.

  </div>
</div>

### `stopped`

A timer enters the `stopped` status after it has been manually stopped with the <ModifyLink /> request. This is the end of a timer life cycle. From this status, the timer for the current item and `customerId` cannot be restarted . To start a new timer, initiate a new cart with the <InitLink /> request or enable a timer for an existing cart item with the <ModifyLink /> request.

### `elapsed`

A timer enters the `stopped` status when the number of seconds specified in the timer settings elapses. This is the end of a timer life cycle. From this status, the timer for the current item and `customerId` cannot be restarted . To start a new timer, initiate a new cart with the <InitLink /> request or enable a timer for an existing cart item with the <ModifyLink /> request.


## Enabling a timer {#timer-enable}

By default, timers are disabled (not set). You can enable a timer at the beginning of the payment life cycle with the <InitLink /> request or at any other stage of the payment process using the <ModifyLink /> request. By enabling a timer, you define its settings like starting conditions and the countdown value.

:::tip
With the <ModifyLink /> request, you can disable any timer at any moment regardless of its current status.
:::

## Starting a timer {#timer-start}

A timer can be started by a trigger event or manually. Until started, an enabled timer stays in the `pending` state.

### Trigger Events {#trigger-events}

A trigger event is an item [payment status](/docs/concepts/lifecycle). For example, if you set `authorized` as a trigger event, the timer will start the countdown as soon as the item enters the `authorized` status. Any future, current, or past trigger event can be selected. Consider the following examples.

* You set a timer using the <InitLink /> request with the `initiated` status as the trigger event. The item timer countdown starts immediately after the request is processed with no errors.
* The current item status is `captured` and you set a timer using the <ModifyLink /> request with the `authorized` status as the trigger event. The item timer countdown starts immediately after the request is processed with no errors as the `authorized` status is prior to the `captured` status.
* The item is not initiated or in any status prior to `refunded`. You set a timer using the <InitLink /> or <ModifyLink /> request with the `refunded` status as the trigger event. The item timer countdown starts if the item enters the `refunded` state.

:::tip
It's up to you whether to use timers and how to utilize them. If we refer to the last example, you, for some reason, might want to prevent your customer from purchasing the item they asked to refund for a certain period of time (or forever, if the countdown value is set to `0`).
:::

### Manual start {#manual-start}

An enabled timer can be started manually from the `pending` or `paused` state with the <ModifyLink /> request. Note that you can start the timer manually prior to a previously set trigger event. On that event, the timer will continue the countdown. If a timer is manually started and elapses before a previously set trigger event, it is not restarted as the `elapsed` status is final in the timer life cycle.

## Countdown {#countdown}

The timer works as a countdown, its value is specified in seconds. For example, to set a timer for 2 hours, pass `7200` as the timer value in the <InitLink /> or <ModifyLink /> request. If you need to set a timer for 3 days, pass `259200` and so on. 

:::tip
If you pass value `0`, the timer is infinite. For example, you can utilize this for items that cannot be purchased more than once like unique artifacts in video games or one-time pro upgrades. Later you can always change the timer settings with the <ModifyLink /> request.

## End of Timer Life Cycle {#end-of-timer-life-cycle}

When a timer elapses or is stopped manually, it reaches the end of its life cycle and cannot be restarted. To set a new timer for an item, you need to initiate a new cart (or modify an existing one) with the `customerId` value and timer settings.

### Countdown End {#countdown-end}

A timer's countdown ends when the number of seconds specified in the timer settings of the <InitLink /> or <ModifyLink /> request elapses. If a timer is manually paused after it starts, the countdown freezes until manually unpaused. To unpause a timer, pass the `start` value of the `manualAction` property in the <ModifyLink /> request.

:::note
A paused timer is still active. That means that you cannot initiate the current item with the same `customerId` value until the timer elapses or is stopped manually.
:::

### Manual Stop {#manual-stop}

A timer can be manually stopped from the `paused` or `started` state. To stop a timer, pass the `stop` value of the `manualAction` property in the <ModifyLink /> request. 

:::warning Please, note
You cannot restart a stopped timer for the current item. To start a new timer, initiate a new cart (or modify an existing one) with the `customerId` value and timer settings.
