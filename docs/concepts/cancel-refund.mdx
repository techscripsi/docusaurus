# Cancellation and Refund

Cancellation and refund are two different operations that can be done on different stages of the [payment life cycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle).

Cancellation is possible with the two-step payment scheme. This operation can be done after a payment is authorized and before it is captured. At this stage, the customer's money has not been transferred from their account. Instead, it is held on their account waiting to be captured by the merchant. On cancellation, the issuing bank removes the hold from the customer's funds, and the funds are released back to the customer. Another word for cancellation is reversal.

Refund is done after a payment has been completed. At this stage, the customer's money is transferred to the target account so it has to be transferred back to their account. This operation may incur fees.

:::tip Please, keep in mind
* All items to be canceled must be in the `authorized` status.
* All items to be refunded must be in the `completed` status.

Use the <StatusLink /> request to check the current item statuses.
:::

Although cancellation and refund are two different operations, the required API properties are the same. The information below applies to both.

You can cancel or refund an entire cart or specific cart items with the <CancelLink /> and <RefundLink /> requests respectively. There is also an option to partially cancel or refund specific cart items. To do that, the <ModifyLink /> request is used.

:::warning Please, note
Neither the <CancelLink /> nor <RefundLink /> request affects item timers. If you need to change timer settings, use the <ModifyLink /> request. See the [Item Timers](/docs/concepts/timer) for more information.

## Entire Cart {#cart}

:::info
After canceling or refunding the entire cart, all cart items enter the `canceled` or `refunding` status respectively.
:::

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      To cancel or refund an entire cart, use the <CancelLink /> or <RefundLink /> request respectively. The only mandatory property is `cartId` passed with the <InitLink /> request earlier.
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
      ```js

## Specific Items {#items}

:::info
After canceling or refunding specific cart items, these items enter the `canceled` or `refunding` status respectively.

      To cancel or refund specific cart items, use the <CancelLink /> or <RefundLink /> request respectively. The specify the request scope, apart from the mandatory `cartId` value, provide the criteria for the items to be canceled or refunded in the `filterBox` object. 
      
      You can use the `tags` and `itemIds` objects and the `timerEnabled` property.
      :::warning Please, note
      The requested cart must contain the specified tags or item identifiers, otherwise, the request will fail.

      The `tags` and `itemIds` objects and the `timerEnabled` property can be used in combinations.
      
      The `tags` criterion ignores overlaps with the `itemIds` object properties. Consider the following example. You specify a tag and an item that is marked with the specified tag in the same request. OmniCart will cancel/refund all items marked with the specified tag and ignore the fact that the item is actually specified twice: with the tag and with its identifier.
      
      If you pass the `timerEnabled` property, the request scope will be narrowed down to the items based on their timer settings (see the [Item Timers](/docs/concepts/timer) section for more information). 
      * `"timerEnabled": false` - the request applies only to the items with disabled (not set) timers.
      * `"timerEnabled": true` - the request applies only to the items with enabled timers.

          The example above assumes that the `crystal` item has been marked with the `rampart` tag and the `gems` item has no tags at all. The request will affect all items with the `rampart` tag including the `crystal` item **and** the `gems` item that is untagged.

            }
          ```
          The example above assumes that the cart contains the `rampart`, `tower`, and `inferno` tags and each tag is applied to at least one item with an enabled timer. The request will affect only the items that are both marked with one of the above tags and have enabled timers. Other items will be ignored.

          ```
          The example above assumes that the cart contains the `necropolis` and `dungeon` tags. The `necropolis` tag is applied to at least one item with a disabled (not set) timer. No items marked with the `dungeon` tag have enabled or disabled timers.
          
          In this case, the request will fail.

## Specific Items, partial cancellation/refund {#partial}

With OmniCart, it is possible to partially cancel or refund cart items. For example, this might be needed if a customer paid for a product and, for some reason, the product cannot be (or was not) delivered in full quantity. To do this, use the <ModifyLink /> request to change the item amount to a lower value. Note that you cannot increase the item amount with the `modify` request (see the [Modifying Items](/docs/concepts/modify) and the [Amounts](/docs/concepts/amounts) sections for more information). The difference between the initial amount and the modified amount will be returned to the customer automatically.

Partial cancellation or refund can be done multiple times. That said, to fully cancel or refund an item, use the <CancelLink /> and <RefundLink /> requests respectively, as changing an item amount to zero is not allowed.

:::warning Please, note
After a partial cancellation or refund, an item remains in the `authorized` or `completed` status respectively.
