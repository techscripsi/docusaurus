# Amounts

A total cart amount is not passed to OmniCart by a single property. Instead, amounts are specified per item identifier. This allows flexible control over the payment life cycle.

During the payment life cycle amounts can be canceled or refunded fully and partially.

:::note
See the [Payment Life Cycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle) section for more information on the items payment life cycle.

## `init` and `modify` requests {#amountmode}

The `amount` property is passed with the [`init`](/docs/api/10-init) or [`modify`](/docs/api/40-modify) request. The optional `amountMode` property defines how OmniCart will treat the value passed in the item `amount` property. The available options for `amountMode` are `declared` and `calculated`. `amountMode` can be defined on the cart, tag, and item level.

:::note
By default, `amountMode` is `declared`.

    <div class="col col--6">
    ### `"amountMode": "declared"`
    If `amountMode` is set to `declared`, the value of the `amount` property is included in the invoice exactly as it was received form from by OmniCart. The additional `quantity` and `amuntModifier`  properties are saved in OmniCart but have no effect on the final item price.
    ### `"amountMode": "calculated"`
    If `amountMode` is set to `calculated`, the `amount` value is the price per unit of goods (actual items, liters, minutes, etc.). The final price is a product of the `amount`, `quantity`, and `amountModifier` values.
    * `quantity` - number or volume of goods. Can be a whole number or a decimal fracture. For example, you can sell mana in bottles or in liters.
    * `amountModifer` - additional `amount` multiplier. You can use it to apply discounts or for any purpose you see fit.
    :::tip
    Technically, `quantity` and `amountModifer` are just `amount` multipliers. However, `quantity` can be defined only on the item level while `amountModifer` can be defined on the cart, tag, and item level.

        In the example above, `amountMode` is `declared`. That means only the `amount` value is taken into account. The final price for the `gems` item is `5000`.
        
        The `quantity` and `amountModifier` properties are stored by OmniCart but they do not affect the final item price.

            }
        ```
        In the example above, `amountMode` is `calculated`. That means the final price is calculated by OmniCart upon receiving the [init](/docs/api/10-init) or [modify](/docs/api/40-modify) request. The final item price is a product of `amount`, `quantity`, and `amountModifier`, that is, `14000`.
        :::warning Please, note
        The result is rounded to the nearest whole number. If the resulting number is less that `1`, OmniCart will return an error.

## `status` request {#status}

### `totalAmounts` and `itemAmounts` objects {#totalamounts-itemamounts}

`totalAmounts` and `itemAmounts` are objects that are returned in successful responses to the [status](/docs/api/15-status) method. 
:::note
See the [Payment Life Cycle](/docs/concepts/lifecycle) section for more information on payment statuses.
:::

The `totalAmounts` and `itemAmounts` objects have same sets of properties. The difference is as follows.

The `totalAmounts` object contains information on the total amounts per certain statuses for the entire request scope at the time of request. That means that if you, for example, filter your [status](/docs/api/15-status) request by a tag, the `totalAmounts` object will contain the total amounts of all cart items marked with that tag. The [status](/docs/api/15-status) request returns only one `totalAmounts` object.

The `itemAmounts` objects are part of item objects and contain information on the amounts per certain statuses of specific items at the time of the request. There are as many `itemAmounts` objects as there are items in the [status](/docs/api/15-status) scope. If a [status](/docs/api/15-status) request returns a single item, the `itemAmounts` values are equal to the `totalAmounts` values.

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      * `initiated` - the initial amount that was registered with the [`init`](/docs/api/10-init) request.
      * `captured` - the authorized amount that has been captured with the [`capture`](/docs/api/30-capture) request. Note that item amounts can be partially canceled before being captured, so this value may be different from the `initiated` amount. Also, cart items do not have to be captured all at once, therefore, a cart may contain items that are authorized but hasn't been captured or canceled, hence, this value may change. However, the`captured` amount cannot exceed the `initiated` amount.
      * `refunded` - the completed amount that has been refunded. Similar to the above, item amounts can be partially refunded, so this value may be different from the `captured` amount. As in the previous case, you have an option to refund selected items from the cart, not necessarily the entire cart. That means that the `refunded` value may change, however, the`refunded` amount cannot exceed the `captured` amount.
    </div>
    <div class="col col--6">
      <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="totalAmounts">
          ```js
          //highlight-next-line
          "cartId": "6f891edb-1e1f-48bb-b042-2cb790a0f402",
          "currency": "USD",
          //highlight-next-line
          "totalAmounts": {
            "initiated": 19900,
            "captured": 0,
            "refunded": 0,
            "current": 19000
          },
          ```
          In the example above the sum of all initiated cart items is `19900`. After the cart was authorized, some of the cart items were fully or partially `canceled` worth of `900` and none of them were `captured`. Therefore, the `captured` cart amount is `0` and the `current` cart amount it `19000`.
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="itemAmounts">
          ```js
          //highlight-next-line
          "gems": {
            "paymentStatus": "completed",
          //highlight-next-line
            "itemAmounts": {
              "initiated": 1200,
              "captured": 1200,
              "refunded": 200,
              "current": 1000
            },
          ```
          In the example above the `gems` item was initiated and captured for the amount of `1200` without cancellations. After being completed, this item was partially refunded for the amount of `200`. Since it's not a full refund, the item state is `completed` but its current amount is less than the captured one.
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

* `current` - current amount of a cart or item. For example, if the some cart items are `authorized` and partially canceled, their current amount is less than the `initiated` amount. Similarly, if some cart items are `captured` or `completed` and partially refunded, their `current` amount is less that the `captured` amount.

### `paymentSnapshot` object {#paymentsnapshot}

<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col col--6">
      The `paymentSnapshot` object is part of the item object that is returned in the response to the [`status`](/docs/api/15-status) request. It contains the values that were defined in the preceding [`init`](/docs/api/10-init) or [`modify`](/docs/api/40-modify) request (see the description given [earlier](#totalamounts-itemamounts) on this page).
      
      Note that if `amountMode` is set to `declared`, the `current` value of the `itemAmounts` object duplicates the `amount` (in the example to the right it is `600`) value since amount multipliers `quantity` and `amountModifier` are not applied.
      
      Otherwise, if the `amountMode` is set to `calculated`, the `current` value of the `itemAmounts` object is a product of the `amount`, `quantity`, and `amountModifier` values. In the example to the right it is `4000`.
